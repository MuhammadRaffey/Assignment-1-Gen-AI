### Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is that field of study leading toward systems developing the ability to carry out tasks which, in one way or another, are characteristic of human intelligence: reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, and it involves the creation of systems capable of adapting through learning from experience. Such algorithms tend to improve their performance on a particular task with experience.

### Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in the domain of artificial intelligence. It uses a large number of many-layered interconnections in a neural network to process a huge amount of data and understand complex structures by mapping data into its classes, that is, image and speech recognition.

### Generative AI

A Generative AI is the task of creating new content based on learned patterns from existing data, such as text, images, music, and more. Examples in use are GPT-4 for text generation and DALL-E for image generation.

### Applied AI

Applied AI is the application of artificial intelligence technologies into practice while resolving a problem. Some areas in which applied AI are found include healthcare for diagnostics, finance for fraud detection, marketing for personalized recommendations, and transportation for autonomous vehicles.
